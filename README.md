# Wordpress Countdown Timer BB

### Purpose
For one landing page that I needed to make there was a request to have a countdown timer showing the Days, Hours, Minutes and Seconds until a specific date and time. I first looked to see what timer plugins already existed were available. I quickly discovered that most had far more bells and whistles that would involve extensive frontend modification to reach the desired look and feel needed for this project. That is when I decided to create this quick and dirty bare-bones plugin.

### How to use
Once the plugin has been installed and activated on a site, you can go into the page copy and call it using the shortcode ``countdown`` then use a date attribute to specify a date and time to be the target countdown. Here are some examples of what the shortcode would  look like in the body copy:
```
[countdown date="1/1/2019"]
[countdown date="1/15/2019 13:00"]
[countdown date="1/30/2019 5:00"]
[countdown date="2/1/2019 17:00"]
```

### Clean up
There are a few things that could stand to be cleaned up about this plugin. For one, the themes that I was activating this plugin on utilized bootstrap. *You can see the reference to that in the HTML generated by shortcode*. That code could be cleaned up to instead make use of custom CSS classes that set the width and alignment. I might modify this someday to account for that.
